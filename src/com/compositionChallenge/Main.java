/**
 * Created by kloupos on 09/01/2017.
 *
 * Create a single room of a house using composition
 * Think about the things that should be included in the room
 * Maybe physical parts of the house but furniture as well
 * And at least one method to access an object via a getter and
 * then that objects public method as you saw in the composition package
 * then add at least one method to hide the object e.g. not using a getter
 * but to access the object used in composition within the main class
 * like you saw in composition video.
